# Practical 1: Python venv and Using JupyterLab

Python virtual environments create a self-contained and isolated environment for different Python projects. This would enable you to install a specific version of a module on a per project basis which will not affect your other Python projects.

1. Launch the setup Ubuntu-xx.xx distro with the PowerShell with the command:
    ~~~bash
    PS C:\Users\TARUMT> wsl -l -v
    PS C:\Users\TARUMT> wsl –d <distro name> -u hduser
    hduser@MyPC:~$ 
    ~~~
    > Proceed as follows if the required distribution is the default WSL distro
    ~~~bash
    PS C:\Users\TARUMT> wsl ~
    hduser@MyPC:~$ 
    ~~~

2. Login as the user student, to create a virtual environment
    ~~~bash
    hduser@MyPC:~$ su - student
    ~~~
    
    2.1 Create a project directory (e.g., de-prj)
      ~~~bash
      student@MyPC:~$ mkdir de-prj
      ~~~
      > It is advisable to utilize distinct directories for each project development.

    2.2 Create a virtual environment for your project (e.g., de-venv):
      ~~~bash
      $ python3 -m venv de-prj/de-venv
      $ de-prj/de-venv/bin/python -m pip install -U --quiet pip wheel setuptools 
      $ de-prj/de-venv/bin/python -m pip install -U --quiet ipykernel
      $ de-prj/de-venv/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name "de-venv" --display-name  "de-venv"
      ~~~

3. Using JupyterLab

   3.1 Activate the virtual environment, and run JupyterLab with commands
     ~~~bash
     student@MyPC:~$ cd ~
     student@MyPC:~$ source de-prj/de-venv/bin/activate
     (de-venv) student@MyPC:~$ jupyter lab
     ~~~

   3.2 Access JupyterLab
       From the output shown in your terminal, **copy and paste one of the URLs in a web browser**.

   * To create a jupyter notebook based on your virtual environment, under the **Notebook**, just click on the kernel with your virtual environment name, e.g., de-venv.

   * To close a jupyter notebook and shut down the kernel (i.e., de_venv), under the jupyter notebook as the active tab, click **File** and then select **Close** and **Shut Down Notebook…**

     > Merely closing the tab does not shut down the notebook, and therefore it is still running in the background. Therefore, be sure to click Close and Shut Down Notebook as highlighted above.
   
   * To logout from JupyterLab, click **File** and then select **Log Out**

   * To shut down the jupyterlab server, go to the terminal where you ran the command to start JupyterLab, i.e., in Step 3.1. Press <Ctrl><C> and type ‘y’ to confirm that you want to shut down the server.

   3.3 To delete any unwanted venv, if needed, try the command with 
      > Syntax: jupyter kernelspec uninstall unwanted-kernel
      > 
      > Example 1:
      > 
      > student@MyPC:~$ jupyter kernelspec uninstall alpha-venv
      > 
      > Example 2:
      > 
      > student@MyPC:~$ jupyter kernelspec uninstall de-venv
      > 

5. Installing python packages in your virtual environment

   4.1 Activate the virtual environment
      ~~~bash
      student@MyPC:~$ source de-prj/de-venv/bin/activate
      ~~~

   4.2 Update the python build packages
      ~~~bash
      (de-venv) student@MyPC:~$ pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
      ~~~
     
   4.3 Install packages
      ~~~bash
      (de-venv) student@MyPC:~$ pip install numpy pandas pyspark==3.5.3
      ~~~
      > Please be aware that the download and installation process will be time-consuming. Ensure the PySpark version corresponds with your Apache Spark installation
      
   4.4 Deactivate the virtual environment. Once you no longer need to work in the environment, you may deactivate the environment to return to your normal shell.
      ~~~bash
      (de-venv) student@MyPC:~$ deactivate
      ~~~
