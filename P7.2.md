# PRACTICAL 7.2: Hadoop in Secure Mode

1. In this practical, you will attempt to set up a 4-node cluster with the following hostnames in the Linux environment (i.e., not WSL):
   * florence1
   * sicily1
   * turin1
   * tuscany1

2. Organise yourselves in 4 teams and assign a different hostname (florence1, sicily1, turin1 or tuscany1) to each team.

3. Each team should start/restart a PC. At the EasyOS screen, quickly select Ubuntu 22.04 within 5 seconds. Then, carry out the following steps. 
Note that 
   i. You do not need to ssh into the different hosts as you are already directly assessing the respective PCs.

   ii. You will need to configure the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

   iii. Add host entries of other nodes in each of the cluster nodes. Open the file /etc/hosts and add lines for each node:
        * <ip_address> shifu.cat.uni.com shifu
        * <ip_address> po.cat.uni.com po
        * <ip_address> tigress.cat.uni.com tigress
    > Reminder: Replace the placeholders <ip_address> with the corresponding IP addresses of the nodes.

   iv. To test forward and reverse look-up:
     ~~~bash
     $ nslookup <FQDN>
     $ nslookup <ip_address>
     ~~~
     
    v. To verify connectivity between hosts, ping each host's FQDN:
    ~~~bash
    $ ping <FQDN>
    ~~~


4. Kerberos Installation and Configuration

   i. Carry out the steps in Kerberos Setup for Apache Hadoop Multi-Node Cluster - https://ravi-chamarthy.medium.com/kerberos-setup-for-apache-hadoop-multi-node-cluster-6bd8a2fbe680 , https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OLzJ6Ak3dGL6Jt3PObFHp9O21xwQow8X/view?usp=drive_link

   ii. Exceptions: Step 3: Install JDK
      * Check if Java 8 has been installed
      ~~~bash
      $ ls -l /usr/lib/jvm/
      ~~~
      
      * Install OpenJDK if not installed yet.
      ~~~bash
      $ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
      ~~~
      
      * Check if the Java 8 was installed successfully
      ~~~bash
      $ ls -l /usr/lib/jvm/
      ~~~
      
      * Set JAVA_HOME
      ~~~bash
      $ nano ~/.bashrc
      ~~~
      > Replace JAVA_HOME target with:
      >
      > export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
