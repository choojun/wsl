MongoDB Atlas is a cloud database that runs on the cloud providers, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. It enables users to host Database Clusters and connect to them remotely. 
The following instructions were correct at the time of writing. If there have been any updates to the MongoDB Atlas website since then, do follow the new instructions provided there.

1. MongoDB Atlas Sign Up

   Sign-up for a free MongoDB Atlas account. Follow the instructions given in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXgJyuBeb_o) to create a free cluster.

   > Important: take note of the following details:
   > 
   > In step 1, for Driver, select “Python” and for Version, select “3.11 or later”
   >
   > In step 2, install the driver in your venv.
   >
   > In step 3, replace the password in the connection string as instructed. This connection string will be used for connecting to your cluster.


Writing Code using PyMongo
Reference MongoDB University: Python Developer Path

Install the library in your venv
$ pip install python-dateutil

Review the code in NOTEBOOK 4.2 PyMongo.

In MongoDB Atlas, use Browse Collections to see the newly inserted documents.



For good system design that incorporates reusability, readability, ease of maintenance: create a centralised file for your MongoDB connection code. 
Create a Python file named pymongo_utils.py with the following lines of code.

from pymongo import MongoClient

# Replace with your connection string and password
CONNECTION_STRING = "<your connection string>"

class PyMongoUtils:
    
    def __init__(self, uri=CONNECTION_STRING):
        self.uri = uri    

    def get_database(self, database_name):
        client = MongoClient(self.uri)
        return client[database_name]


Further explore the use of pymongo for your assignment:

Write code to insert documents into your collection

Write code to query data.

Write code to convert the list of dictionaries from the query to a PySpark DataFrame.
