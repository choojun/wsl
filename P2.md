PRACTICAL 2: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

1. Launch the setup Ubuntu-xx.xx distro with the PowerShell with the command:
   ~~~bash
   PS C:\Users\TARUMT> wsl ~
   hduser@MyPC:~$ 
   ~~~

2. Login as the user hduser, start HDFS and YARN 

   2.1 Start the HDFS service, and check the services currently running, use the jps command.
       ~~~bash
       hduser@MyPC:~$ start-dfs.sh
       Starting namenodes on [localhost]
       Starting datanodes
       Starting secondary namenodes [MyPC]

       hduser@MyPC:~$ jps
       1392 Jps
       1114 SecondaryNameNode
       876 DataNode
       685 NameNode
       ~~~

    2.2 Start the YARN service
       ~~~bash
       hduser@MyPC:~$ start-yarn.sh
       Starting resourcemanager
       Starting nodemanagers

       hduser@MyPC:~$ jps
       2112 Jps
       1696 NodeManager
       1542 ResourceManager
       1114 SecondaryNameNode
       876 DataNode
       685 NameNode
       ~~~
   
       > FYI only, the following actions have already been completed in the setup of distro:
       > Create the directories named user and tmp in the distributed file system: 
       > The /user directory is where all Hadoop usersâ€™ home directories will be created later on.
       > ~~~bash
       > hduser@MyPC:~$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /user
       > hduser@MyPC:~$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /tmp
       > ~~~
       > Give  full permissions for all users to the tmp directory:
       > ~~~bash
       > hduser@MyPC:~$ hdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 /tmp
       > ~~~
   
3. Create User Directories in HDFS

   3.1 Create a HDFS user directory for student:
      ~~~bash
      hduser@MyPC:~$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/student
      ~~~

    3.2 Change ownership for the newly created directory:
      ~~~bash
      hduser@PC25:~$ hdfs dfs -chown student:hduser /user/student
      ~~~
      
      > HDFS file permissions are similar to Linux file permissions. 
      > E.g., to change the permission of the file shakespeare.txt to 664:
      > $ hdfs dfs -chmod 664 shakespeare.txt 
      > where 664 is an octal representation of the flags to set for the permission triple.
      > The above statement  changes the permissions to -rw-rw-r--:
      > 6 is 110, which means read and write, but not execute.
      > 7 is 111, which means complete permissions.
      > 4 is 100, which means read-only.


~~~ As the user student ~~~ 

Switch user to student
hduser@PC25:~$ su - student
student@PC25:~$


HDFS Basic File System Operations
See the available commands in the dfs shell
student@PC25:~$ hdfs dfs -help

Download the shakespeare.txt file from Google Drive into your local file system (Ubuntu 22.04)
student@PC25:~$ wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=122PnuKaSaA_OyYOKnxQOdlMc5awdyf5v' -O shakespeare.txt
ðŸ’¡ Remember to confirm that the above action is successful.

Copy the downloaded file shakespeare.txt from the local file system to HDFS
student@PC25:~$ hdfs dfs -put shakespeare.txt shakespeare.txt
ðŸ’¡ Remember to confirm that the above action is successful.

Read the contents of the file in HDFS using the cat command, and then pipe the output to less in order to view the contents of the remote file.  
student@PC25:~$ hdfs dfs -cat shakespeare.txt | less 
Note: use the arrow keys to navigate the file. Type q to quit.

Copy the file from HDFS to the local file system and rename it as shakespeare-dfs.txt.
student@PC25:~$ hdfs dfs -get shakespeare.txt ./shakespeare-dfs.txt
 ðŸ’¡ Remember to confirm that the above action is successful.


To end your practical sessions
Logout from the student account
student@PC25:~$ exit
hduser@PC25:~$ su - student

~~~ As the user hduser ~~~ 
Terminate the YARN service
hduser@PC25:~$ stop-yarn.sh

Terminate the HDFS service
hduser@PC25:~$ stop-dfs.sh

Logout from the hduser account
hduser@PC25:~$ exit
PS C:\Users\TARUMT> 

Terminate the WSL instance
PS C:\Users\TARUMT> exit

Other HDFS Commands
Recall that the HDFS shell commands are similar to POSIX-like commands and invoked using:
$ hdfs dfs <args> <command>

Other HDFS commands include:
cat
chgrp
chmod
chown
cp
du
ls
mkdir
mv
rm
stat
tail
